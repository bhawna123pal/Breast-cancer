Breast cancer is common cancer among women. In this project i have predicted if a women have cancer or not in next 10 years based on given features in dataset using machine learning. I created a machine learning model that will predict who have cancer or not. i downloaded dataset from kaggle and import in jupyter notebook aftr that i droped sample code number feature which is irrelevent and nxt step is to check null value and after that i checked for correlation and devide the data into dependent and independent variable and split the data into train and test data, after that scale down all the feature and fit thw model to dataset i used logistic regression..and evaluate the model performance using confusion metrics and roc,auc and used oversampling technique because class feature have imbalaced classification..
